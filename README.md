Dynamic Fluid Particle Simulator:

Project Description: 

	The final product is an interactive 3D and 2D fluid particle simulator. The 3D model allows the user to view dispersion in 3D and to rotate the camera angle. The 2D simulation of the water allows for the user to freely create water and ground tiles and see the interaction of water through properties of cohesion, surface tension, dispersion, and movement. There is also an incorporated game mode that allows the user to move the water from one place to another. 

How to run the project

	The product can be run normally through an editor. As long as the image files are in the same directory the program should work normally. The user also needs to have opengl and pygame installed. 

A list of any shortcut commands that exist

All instructions are listed in the program if you press h in either game or build mode. The 3d mode only has access to the arrow keys, which change the camera angle.
In game mode:
r - resets the board
mouse - erases the items
In build mode:
r - resets the board
f - activates force
p - pauses and unpauses
s - switches materials
mouse - lays items down
m - enters stage building mode
If in stage building mode:
e - erases blocks
spacebar - enters game mode
